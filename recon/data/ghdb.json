Want to make matters worse for yourself as an admin? OK, configure your external proxy server as a trusted internal host. Load up your web browser, set your proxy as their proxy and surf your way into their intranet. Not that I've noticed any examples of this in this google list. *COUGH* *COUGH* *COUGH*  unresolved DNS lookups give clues *COUGH* *COUGH* ('scuse me. must be a furball) OK, lets say BEST CASE scenario.

Providing a relative path (from the document repository) in the \"pathext\" variable will cause FileManager to provide a directory listing of that diretory. Selecting a file in that listing, or putting a file name in the \"view\" variable, will cause EasyWeb to load the file specified. Only files and directories which can be read by the system user running PHP can be retrieved.Assuming PostNuke is installed at the root level:/etc directory listing:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&type=admin&func=manager&pathext=../../../etc/etc/passwd file:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&type=admin&func=manager&pathext=../../../etc/&view=passwdFix/Workaround:Use another file manager module for PostNuke, as the authors do not appear to bemaintaining EW FileManager.Vendor Status: Vendor was contacted but did not respond.Credir: Sullo - cirt.netNOTE: mitigating factor, an attacker needs to be registred and logged on to have access rights to this module."

This leaves the web cracker with the only viable option to come in contact with a large number of proxies being to use public proxy lists. These are of course very slow, and very very unstable, and do not allow the cracker much time between his proxy runs.Luckily google gives them another option, if they are smart enough to find it.CGI-proxy ( http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/ ) is a CGI-based proxy application. It runs on a web server, and acts as an http proxy, in CGI form. A prudent site owner would hide it behind .htaccess, as most do, but with a powerful tool like google, the inprudent few who leave it open can quickly be seperated from the wise masses.CGI-proxy's default page contains the text, as you can see in the demo on their site:\"Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy by entering a URL below. Only HTTP and FTP URLs are supported. Not all functions will work (e.g. some JavaScript), but most pages will be fine.\"The proxy as it resides on a server is most often called nph-proxy.cgi. A web cracker can now use google to enumerate his list of proxy servers, like so:inurl:\"nph-proxy.cgi\" \"Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy\"More results can be obtained by admitting the \"inurl:nph-proxy.cgi\" constraint, but much more trash is generated as well."
